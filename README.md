# Advent-of-Code-2022
A repository to store my solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code Problems as I complete and update them.
Solutions generally consist of two functions--the first solves the first problem and the second solves the second. Running the code in its location in the repository prints the solutions to parts 1 and 2 of the problem in question in order.
Solutions have a comment at the top of the file that says "Code Works" if the code solves both parts of the problem. If there is no statement, the code has not passed yet.
Efforts are made to generalize the code to situations broader than the prompt whenever possible.
